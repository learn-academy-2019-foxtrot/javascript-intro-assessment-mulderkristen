# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function takes in an argument or arugments, performs an action to change data or returns specific data. You would use a function when you want to perform an action or return something from a set of data. 

  Researched answer: Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.



2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: .push adds a value to the end, .unshift adds a value to the beginning, .shift removes a value at the beginning, .pop removes a value from the end, .split splits a string into an array

  Researched answer: .length appens a new value to an array, .splice adds new items to an array, .slice takes out a piece of an array into a new array



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console log will log the return statement to your console and return asks for specific information within a function

  Researched answer: console.log will display the parameter passed to the log method in the console window. Use this method to display a string or variable in the console window. When using the return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value.





4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: The argument is what the function will take in to perform the action, a variable is a defined datatype that can be passed through as an argument. 

  Researched answer: Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked. Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: In pair programming, there is a driver and a navigator. The driver is doing the typing while the navigator is helping the driver to enter the proper code and collaborate on best practice. Good practice is to switch on and off evenly. 

  Researched answer: I didn't know pair programming dates back to the 90s! "1998: in “Chrysler goes to Extremes”, the earliest article about Extreme Programming, pair programming is presented as one of the core practices of the C3 team; it is later described formally as one of XP’s original “twelve practices”"



6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: When we're on the internet, we often add or ask for information, perform tasks, or connect with friends. All of these actions require someone to build them for us, and one of these programs we can use to build is called JavaScript. JavaScript is where most of the decision making tasks get added, so it's more behind the scenes and doesn't really interact too much with the "look" of what you're seeing. 

7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Testing was really helpful! I felt much better about my understanding of functions after using jest to test them!
